HDFS:
-Hadoop Distributed File System is a file system used by hadoop applications for file storage.
-HDFS breaks a file into numerous pieces and saves it in different systems across the cluster using master-slave architecture.
-HDFS is developed in such a way that it can run on low hardware commodity machines with high fault tolerance.
-Provides fast transfer of data between nodes in the cluster.
-It can handle server issue, hardware failure and disk problems.
-It uses blocks for storing the file in different system with default size of block as 128mb(hadoop 2.X) and 64mb(hadoop 1.X).
-It is an important tool in solving a big data problem and supporting big data analytics applications.
-It reduces the risk of data loss by using data redundancy on different server track.

HDFS CLUSTER:
A Hadoop cluster is based on master slave architecture and it is a computational cluster designed specifically for storing 
and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data. 
These cluster are open source and this makes it flexible for people to alter it to their needs.
Since the cluster is open source, it is hardly debated and developed by professionals all around the world.
There are master and slave machines in the cluster to maintain the hierarchy.
 Masters in the HDFS are NameNode and JobTracker(in Hadoop 1.X) or ResourceManager(in Hadoop 2.X)  
The rest of the machines in the cluster act as both DataNode and TaskTracker(Hadoop 1.X) or NodeManager(Hadoop 2.X) and are called slaves.

HDFS blocks:
HDFS stores huge data into small units called block.
Default size of a block is 128mb(hadoop 2.X) and 64mb(hadoop 1.X)
HDFS distributes these blocks in the NameNodes, also duplicating it on some system to prevent data loss. 
By using these blocks, we can reduce the seek time as low as possible.
Blocks are stored in a continous manner in a HDFS system.
One block can also contain data from two different files, for e.g
For a 100Mb file, a block of 64mb is used
1 full block of 64mb is utilised and 1 block of 36Mb is utilised, the rest of 64mb in the second file can be utilised by another file also.
